# Auto-Complete Project Overview

## Project Structure

The Auto-Complete project is organized into several files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **TrieNode.h**: Defines the `TrieNode` class for representing nodes in the trie data structure.
- **AutoComplete.h**: Defines the `AutoComplete` class for providing auto-completion functionality.
- **TrieNode.cpp**: Implementation of the `TrieNode` class methods.
- **AutoComplete.cpp**: Implementation of the `AutoComplete` class methods.
- **main.cpp**: Main entry point for the application, where user input is processed and auto-completion suggestions are provided.

## Data Structures

### Trie Data Structure
The project utilizes a trie data structure to efficiently store and retrieve words for auto-completion. Each node in the trie represents a character, and the paths from root to leaf nodes form words. This structure allows for fast prefix-based searches, making it suitable for auto-complete functionality.

### TrieNode Class
The `TrieNode` class represents a node in the trie. It contains pointers to child nodes, representing characters in words, and a boolean flag to indicate whether the node represents the end of a word.

## Usage
- The `main.cpp` file serves as the entry point for the application. It prompts the user for input and utilizes the `AutoComplete` class to generate auto-completion suggestions based on the entered prefix.
- Users can interact with the application by entering partial words or phrases, and the program will display a list of suggested completions based on the trie data structure.

## Conclusion
The Auto-Complete project is a C++ application that leverages trie data structures to provide efficient auto-completion functionality. By organizing words hierarchically and performing prefix-based searches, the program offers users intelligent suggestions for completing their input.
